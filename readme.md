# Zwift Community Slack Website - zwift-community-slack.netlify.app

Here's where the magic starts. This is the zwift-community-slack.netlify.app website, which is basically a bunch of words wrapped around one critical feature: the  Slack invite. We're using VuePress, a touch of AWS Lambda magic, Netlify for hosting & keeping data updated.
